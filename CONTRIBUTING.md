# Welcome to the LectureCut contributing guide

Thanks for coming by! We're glad you're interested in contributing to LectureCut.
We're a small team of students and we're always looking for help.
If you're interested in contributing, please read the following guidelines.

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for LectureCut.
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one.
When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

<!-- * **Check the [FAQs on the Wiki]() -->
* **Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Gamer92000/LectureCut/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started LectureCut, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal.
* **Provide some context** by explaining which problem you're experiencing, and how you're trying to solve it. What's the current behavior? What's the expected behavior?
* **Include the log file** if an error occured. You can find the log file somewhere (see #5). The log file will most likely be called `lecturecut.log`.
* **Include some metadata** by giving the OS, the terminal, the version of LectureCut, and the version of the used libraries. You currently can't get the version of LectureCut from the program itself, you have to look at the release page on GitHub.
